# npm

NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.

## Lession

Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application:

```
npm init
```

This command prompts you for a number of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults.

We now install a dependency we need in the next lession:

```
npm install express
```
