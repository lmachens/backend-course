## Lession

Run `node app.js` to print the menu card on the command line. This example demonstrate the usage of JavaScript features. In VSCode Debuggin Node.js code is very easy. You can add a breakpoint by clicking on the line number and run the code with `F5` or in the debug menu.

Your task is to create a new folder `models` with a file `menu.js` with the content `console.log('Menu')`. You can test it with `node stock.js` or `npm test 1-node` (from top level).
